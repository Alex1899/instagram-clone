<h1>A photo sharing web application (Instagram clone)</h1>

I have used the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, React.js) to build this web application. Users can create an account, post images, follow other usersâ€™ accounts, like and comment on posts. Currently working on implementing the live chat feature, so that users can send messages to each other. 

Demo of the app is shown below.
